Using an InstallerChoices.xml file.

If your InstaDMG host is running on 10.5 or greater, it will check for the existence of an InstallerChoices.xml file in the same directory as the mpkg you wish to change the installation of.

InÂ this folder are several files:

10.5_OSInstall.mpkg_choiceIdentifiers.txt is a list of the choices that may be used on any 10.5 retail Mac OS X install DVD, same for 10.6(.3).

10.6_InstallerChoices.xml is an example answer file that will direct the installer to not install "Popular and Nearby Printers", deselects any language besides English, deselects Additional Fonts, and includes Rosetta. 10.5_InstallerChoices.xml only installs the English localization, doesn't install other printer drivers besides GutenPrint, and doesn't install the Additional Fonts.

To verify that the choices are still valid with future retail DVD releases, you can create your own InstallerChoices.xml file by following the method described here: http://www.afp548.com/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=18907

Remember that an InstallerChoices.xml file can only be used for Leopard and more recent build trains.
