INTRO
instauser creates a local admin account (instadmg) and password (password).

This 10.5 package does everything with file copies. The dslocal system of Leopard makes this possible.

******************************WARNING!***********************************
As this is an exercise in totally file based user creation you should not run this pkg on an existing system! If you do so it WILL replace your admin group.

If this happens to you then simply re-enable admin rights for the users that lost them.
******************************WARNING!***********************************

There is still a startup item in place to populate the home folder. More than anything this is here as an example of a startup item. On 10.5 we should probably do this with a launchd job though.

Included in this distribution are the instauser script, pkg, and PackageMaker project file.
